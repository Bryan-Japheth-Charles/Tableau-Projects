Project Title: HR Analytics Dashboard (Tableau)

Description:

Designed an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Tableau to visualize key human resources metrics for better strategic decision-making. The dashboard provides insights into employee count, attrition rate, department-wise attrition, educational fields, employee age distribution, job satisfaction across roles, and attrition trends by gender and age group. Key highlights include:

Visualized overall employee statistics including attrition count, active employees, and average employee age.

Created department-wise attrition analysis to identify high-risk areas.

Built age distribution histograms to understand workforce demographics.

Analyzed employee satisfaction scores across different job roles.

Compared attrition rates between male and female employees across various age groups.

Presented educational field distribution among employees.

This project enhanced my data visualization skills and demonstrated the ability to turn raw HR data into actionable business insights using Tableau.
